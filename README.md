GDHeX is a hex tile utility set up that does most of the annoying hex grid math for you.

It will be gaining features as they're requested.

To add to a project:
Copy the 3 classes HexTile, FractionalHexTile, and HexUtils into your LibGDX project.

To use:
Create an instance of HexUtils, and have it generate a grid using generateGrid(width,height).
Most of the other tools inside are self explanatory.
